# 🛡️ CSRF Lab: Referrer Protection Bypass

This repository demonstrates a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** attack by showcasing how to bypass referrer-based protection mechanisms. It provides a hands-on lab to understand such vulnerabilities and adopt secure coding practices.

---

## 📖 Overview

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks exploit the trust that a web application has in a user's browser. This lab focuses on how defenses relying on the `Referer` header can fail and offers guidance to mitigate such issues effectively.
