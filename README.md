# CSRF Lab: Referrer Protection Bypass

This repository demonstrates a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** attack that bypasses protection mechanisms relying on the `Referer` header. The lab highlights how such defenses can be circumvented by manipulating headers or exploiting application misconfigurations.

## Features
- Simulated vulnerable web application
- Referrer-based CSRF protection implementation
- Step-by-step attack demonstration
- Secure coding tips to prevent bypass

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of CSRF attacks
- Familiarity with web application security and HTTP headers
